# Servlet_Cookies

Task 1 - Integrate Thymeleaf templating engine into the project to render time templates in HTML using logic for calculating the current time in the corresponding 
timezone, passing computed parameters and HTML templates to Thymeleaf, and returning the rendered results from the servlet.

Task 2 - Store the last selected timezone in a cookie named "lastTimezone" for the user, allowing retrieval of the timezone from the cookie if the 
timezone parameter is not provided in subsequent requests, defaulting to UTC if the cookie is also absent.
